# Day 12: Json

More than a week has passed since the last challenge. I moved out and it cut my routine. Assembling ikea furniture and unpacking stuff take me too much time. I had to cut elm...

So today I'll continue my journey with a fresh subject, it was a bit daunting to finish the last project. It needed something smaller.

So I pick the next scary stuff that pop up in my mind.... **JSON**

Okay lets try to unmarshal this json file

```json
{
    "firstname":"clark",
    "lastname":"kend",
    "realname":"kal-el",
    "surname":"superman",
    "job":"reporter",
    "address":"the big farm in smallville",
    "friend":[
        {
            "lastname":"lane",
            "firstname":"lois",
            "relationship":"lover"
        },
        {
            "lastname":"who knows",
            "firstname":"jimmy",
            "relationship":"cokorker"
        }
    ]
}
```
