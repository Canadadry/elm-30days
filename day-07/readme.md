# Day 7: a sudoku grid  

Today I did not get really far. Not enough time. Ea h new project I loose a lot of time starting a project. 

Maybe I should stop using ellie to prototype... But I really hate npm and I see everyone starting project with npm. 

Ok so today I wanted to validate a sudoku grid but I only got the time to edit a sukodu grid. Not really interresting. 

For the validation, I wanted to write a `List Int -> Bool` to find if a list has duplicate. 
And find clever function to extract line, column and block

Well that will be for tomorrow.
