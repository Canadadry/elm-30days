# Elm 30 days challenge

My main objective is to learn enough go to start building real world app with it. 

But like everyone I'm blocked by a syntax I don't understand and feel a bit overwhelmed. I already know the basic `init`, `update`, `view` which are awesome by the way.

This is an attempt to write a small bite of elm code everyday

 - Day 1: a todo list
 - Day 2: a balance parenthesis checker
 - Day 3: a minesweeper : the grid system
 - Day 4: a minesweeper : the neighbour stuff and placing mine
 - Day 5: a random int generator and suffling list
